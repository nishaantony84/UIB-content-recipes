    <h1>Easy to cook Chicken Biryani</h1>

      <li>2 cups basmati rice / chawal , aged</li>

      <li>1 onion large , sliced thinly</li>
      <li>¼ tsp red chili powder</li>

        <strong>(or use 2 tsps readymade biryani masala or garam masala )</strong>
      </li>
      <li>1 nutmeg / jaiphal piece , Very small</li>
      <li>4 green cardamoms or choti elaichi</li>
      <li>¼ to ½ tsp Pepper corn / kali mirch</li>

      <li>1 cinnamon stick / dalchini, Small</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make few slits on all the chicken pieces and add to a large bowl. Then
        add the Ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Basmati rice:</strong> There are so many kinds of basmati rice
        available in the market. For best results choose premium quality basmati
        rice that is labelled as AGED. This kind of rice is more firm &amp;
        fluffs up well in chicken biryani without turning mushy. Aged rice is
        also more fragrant. Though this biryani is made in a pressure cooker or
        pot, the texture of rice grains will come out right without getting
        mushy if made with aged rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Biryani masala (spices)</strong>: Good quality whole spices
        &amp; spice powders elevate the flavor of chicken biryani. So choose a
        good quality ready made

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chicken</strong>: We usually use up the cut whole chicken to
        make the chicken biryani. However I always find chicken breast pieces
        dry out if not marinated well with yogurt. If you prefer soft, tender
        &amp; succulent pieces of chicken in your biryani, then just use chicken
        thighs &amp; drumsticks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Always use bone-in chicken as it helps the dish to turn out more
        flavorful.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ghee :</strong> Traditionally chicken biryani was made using
        ghee. Since this recipe does not follow the traditional method, you can
        also make it using oil. But ghee adds a unique aroma to the dish.
